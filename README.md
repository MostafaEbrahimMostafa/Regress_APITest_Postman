# 🚀 Regress API Test - Postman

## 📖 Project Overview
The **Regress API Test** project is designed to validate the functionalities of the **Regress API** using **Postman and Newman**. This project ensures the reliability, accuracy, and efficiency of API responses through structured testing.

## 🎯 Project Objective
The primary objectives of this testing framework are to:
- ✅ **Ensure API reliability and functional correctness** by validating CRUD operations.
- ✅ **Enhance test coverage** across different scenarios, including edge cases and negative testing.
- ✅ **Optimize testing efforts** by reducing manual intervention and executing automated API tests efficiently.
- ✅ **Improve reporting and debugging** through **Newman and HTML reports**, providing insightful execution logs and visualized test results.
- ✅ **Implement best practices** for maintainable and scalable API testing.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Tools
This project is built using the following technologies and tools:

| Technology/Tool         | Purpose |
|------------------------|---------|
| **Postman**            | API testing and request automation |
| **Newman**             | CLI-based execution of Postman collections |
| **JSON Assertions**    | Validates expected vs actual API responses |
| **Collection Runner**  | Batch execution of API test cases |

## 📂 Project Structure
The project follows a well-organized folder structure to ensure scalability and maintainability:

```
RegressAPI/
│── postman/
│   ├── Regress_API_Test.postman_collection.json  # Postman collection with API requests
│   ├── Regress_Environment.postman_environment.json  # Postman environment variables
│── reports/
│   ├── newman/  # Newman HTML reports for test results
│── README.md  # Project documentation
```

## 🌟 Key Features

- **User Operations**:
    - Create a new user.
    - Retrieve user details.
    - Update user information.
    - Delete a user.

- **Authentication Operations**:
    - User login.
    - Token-based authentication validation.

- **Other API Operations**:
    - Data retrieval.
    - Error handling and response validation.

This project represents a **significant step in API test automation**, integrating **Postman and Newman** to streamline API validation. Through the implementation of **best practices in API testing**, the project aims to:

- ✅ **Automate Regress API functionalities**, including user and authentication operations.
- ✅ **Enhance API test execution efficiency** with structured test cases, reusable components, and assertions.
- ✅ **Provide insightful test reporting** with Newman reports, ensuring clear visibility of test results and failures.
- ✅ **Ensure API stability and compliance** by handling different request/response scenarios and error cases.

🔹 I am excited about applying these skills to future projects to drive quality and efficiency! Let’s connect and exchange ideas about enhancing API testing practices.
